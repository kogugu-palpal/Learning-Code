color = "Blue"
# print ("Your favorite color is", + color)
# This code prints the user's favorite color but has a syntax error.
# The '+' operator is incorrectly used here.
# The correct way to concatenate strings in Python is to use a comma or the '+' operator without the '+' before the variable.
# Corrected code:
print("Your favorite color is " + color)
# or
print("Your favorite color is", color)
